So here is a python script that is meant to download the courseware provided at http://wilkins.law.harvard.edu/courses/CopyrightX2015/ which was an offering through www.edx.org.\r\n\r\nRun the script by `python CopyrightX2015.py` at terminal. The script creates a new folder CopyrightX2015 in the current directory, and respective sub-folders for the weeks. The script has a tab width of 5.\r\n\r\nHope this accomplishes the task of managing the downloads regarding this courseware for you.\r\nHappy MOOCing.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
